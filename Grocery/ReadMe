The grocery application is basic version with good quality of code & unit testing.

Still we can add much more standards for better production code base & maintainability

Few of the possibilities are as below.

1. We can add spring mvc level Exception handlers to control standard errors
2. Error messages can be added to provide user on certain validations & failures 
3. We can use Hibernate cache for performance
4. Spring AOP can be better for tracking cross-cutting activities like logging.
5. Can implement Junit / TestNG along with mockitho
